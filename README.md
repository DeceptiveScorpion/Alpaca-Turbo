### Key Features


- *Efficient Conversation*: The language model used in this Gradio WebUI won't repeat what the user already said, it will just respond with the bot's response, making your interactions smooth and seamless.
- *Memory*: This implementation remembers your previous conversations, so you can easily pick up where you left off and continue the conversation.
- *Configuration*: You can easily configure the personality of the bot to match your preferences or to suit the task you are working on.
- Saved Settings: All settings and configurations are saved between runs, so you don't have to reset them every time you use the tool.
- No blabering endlessly
- only output's the bot part of response
